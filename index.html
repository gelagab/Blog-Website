            Our group was awarded as <strong>Top 3 Outstanding System</strong>. After many sleepless nights, we finally saw the result of our hard work.
            <strong>We gave our time, effort, and many sacrifices to complete our system.</strong> Even when we were tired, we continued working and never gave up.
            <strong>This award means a lot to us because it shows that every challenge we faced was worth it.</strong>
            During the project, there were times when we felt stressed and worried. Deadlines were getting closer, and there was still so much to do. But instead of giving up,
            <strong>we stayed focused and helped each other.</strong> We shared ideas and fixed problems as a team.
            <strong>This teamwork made us stronger and more determined to finish our system on time.</strong>
            <strong>This award is not just because of the system we made. It is a recognition of our hard work, passion, and teamwork.</strong> Every late night, every mistake we corrected, and every challenge we solved helped us grow.
            <strong>We learned that success comes when you give your best and work together.</strong> Our sacrifices are now seen and appreciated by others.
            <strong>We are very proud of what we achieved.</strong> It is a reminder that hard work always pays off in the end.
            <strong>This is only the beginning, and we are ready to improve even more.</strong> We will continue learning and growing from this experience.
            <strong>Success is sweeter when you know you gave it your all.</strong>

        <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Gabriel Lazaro</strong>. I am a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology student at <strong>PHINMA Saint Jude College - Manila</strong>. I love this program because it aligns with my passion for technology and continuous learning. Aside from studying, I also enjoy playing the guitar and spending time on mobile and FPS games. A cup of coffee is always my companion whenever I work on my school tasks.</p>
